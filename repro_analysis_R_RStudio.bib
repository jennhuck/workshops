  abstract = {TL;DR: Why should I use here? The here package bottles up several small best practices for referencing files in your project. You could manufacture most of these yourself using a combination of RStudio projects and clever file paths, but the here package is useful because it streamlines these practices without you needing to think about it. The main benefits:  here works from the project up. That makes it easy to reference other sub-folders in your directory.},
