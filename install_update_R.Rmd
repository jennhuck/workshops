# In advance of the workshop
To participate in the workshop, please bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed.  We recommend that you have the latest version of R (4.0.4"Lost Library Book") and of the tidyverse package (1.3.0).  Additionally, you need to have RStudio installed, but it is less crucial that you are using the most recent version. 

Follow these steps to make sure you have R properly installed in advance of the workshop.

Do you already have R and RStudio installed? 

* No - follow the instructions for ["I do not have R installed"](#noinstall)
* Yes - follow the instructions for ["I have R installed"](#yesinstall)


# "I do not have R installed" {#noinstall}
You should install R, RStudio, and tidyverse. 

## Installing R
 
Windows:

1. Go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
2. Click the "Download R 4.0.4 for Windows" link.
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to just click "Next" to all dialogs to finish the installation.
 
Mac:

1. Go to <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>
2. Click the link "R-4.0.4.pkg"
3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to just click "Next" to all dialogs to finish the installation.
 
## Installing RStudio 
 
Download RStudio Desktop  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>.  When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click "Next" to all dialogs to finish the installation.

## Installing tidyverse {#installtidyverse}
Open RStudio.  Go to Tools (at the top)...Install Packages.  Enter `tidyverse`, then select Install. 

You are ready for the workshop!

# "I have R installed" {#yesinstall}
The workshops run more smoothly when everyone is using the same version of R and tidyverse. Please update R and tidyverse, if necessary (and less crucially, RStudio). 

## Verify R version
Open RStudio.  At the top of the Console you will see session info.  The first line tells you which version of R you are using.  If RStudio is already open and you’re deep in a session, type `R.version.string` to print out the R version.

Do you have R version 4.0.4 "Lost Library Book" installed?

* No - follow the instructions for ["Updating R"](#updateR) 
* Yes - Great!  Do you have tidyverse installed?
    + No or I don't know - See ["Installing tidyverse"](#installtidyverse)
    + Yes - Great! In Rstudio, go to Tools > Check for Package Updates.  If there’s an update available for tidyverse, install it.  You want tidyverse version 1.3.0.

## Updating R/RStudio/Tidyverse {#updateR}

Windows:

To update R on Windows, try using the package `installr` (only for Windows). This [installr tutorial](https://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/) is very helpful.  

Make sure you have tidyverse 1.3.0 installed.  Got to Tools (at the top)...Check for package updates.  If tidyverse shows up on the list, select it, then click "Install Updates."

You are ready for the workshop!

3. When the file finishes downloading, double-click to install. You should be able to click "Next" to all dialogs to finish the installation.
